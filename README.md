## Installation

If you wish to use VSD as a library, then you can include it in your
`pyproject.toml` under `dependencies` as,

    "vsd@git+ssh://git@github.com/csiro-funml/variationalsearch.git"

Alternatively if you want to develop VSD, then basic instructions for
installation with `venv` and `pip` are,

    cd path/to/variationalsearch
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install .

Or to also run the experiments, replace the last line above with,

    pip install .[experiments]
    git lfs install
    git lfs pull

If you wish to use to
[poli](https://github.com/MachineLearningLifeScience/poli) solver interface or
to run the Ehrlich function experiment, you will need to use the `poli` optional
dependencies,

    pip install .[poli]


For all functionality and to develop, we recommend installing as below,

    cd path/to/variationalsearch
    python3 -m venv .env
    source .env/bin/activate
    pip install -e .[experiments,poli]
    git lfs install
    git lfs pull


## Experiments


### Notebook

We have included a toy experiment based on finding the super-level distribution
of a 2D mixture of Gaussians. This is probably a good starting point for
understanding all of VSD's components. This demonstrates VSD's ability to also
work in continuous spaces with only modification to the variational
distributions. See `notebooks/gmm_exploration_test.ipynb`.

This experiment was not featured in the paper.


### Biological sequence experiments

These instructions are for the _fitness landscape_ and _black-box optimization_
experiments that involve real sequences (DHFR, TrpB, TFBIND8, GFP and AAV) in
Sections 4.2 and 4.3. All experimental configuration is contained in
`experiments/config.py`.

Before running the experiments, if you do not have any pre-trained predictive
models in the `models/` directory, or if you wish to modify the predictive
models, you will need to run,

    train_cpe --dataset DATASET

to train a class probability estimator, or

    train_gp --dataset DATASET

for training a Gaussian process surrogate. See `train_cpe --help` and
`train_gp --help` for all options. We give the options for `DATASET` below.

- `GFP` for the partially synthetic (oracle predictor) avGFP dataset,
- `DHFR` for the complete-space DHFR dataset,
- `TFBIND8` for the complete-space TF bind 8 datasets,
- `AAV` for the partially synthetic (oracle predictor) AAV dataset,
- `TRPB` for the complete-space TrpB dataset.

Some of these datasets also have a `_FL` prefix, e.g. `DHFR_FL`, which refers to
the "fitness landscape" version of an experiment. That is, where the fitness
threshold is fixed, and precision and recall are measured.

You may also wish to train a prior on some data, this can be done by calling the
`train_prior` command.

    train_prior --dataset DATASET

You can choose to train a prior on all the initial predictor training data, or
just the `fit` subset, see the `dataset["prior"]["use_threshold"]`
configuration parameter.

The experiments can be run by executing the shell script,

    ./run_seq_exp DATASET

Or, you can specify the dataset and method to run by calling,

    batch_rounds --dataset DATASET --method METHOD

See `batch_rounds --help` for all options and option values.

All surrogate model and experimental configuration can be viewed and changed in
`experiments/config.py`. Furthermore, an experiment will save its configuration
to a JSON file, which can also be modified and then used in the
`batch_rounds --config CONFIG` argument.

Run the following commands to replicate the results from the paper (you may
need to parallelize these on multiple GPUs). For the fitness landscape
experiments (section 4.2):

    run_seq_exp DHFR_FL
    run_seq_exp TRPB_FL
    run_seq_exp TFBIND8_FL

or to run the Gaussian process version in appendix section C.1, append the
`-gp` flag to the above command. For the black-box optimization experiments run
the following,

    run_seq_exp AAV
    run_seq_exp GFP

While the fitness landscape experiments can be run on a laptop, we run the BBO
experiments on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU equipped server. After these scripts
have completed, run the following command to create the plots we present in the
paper,

    plot_results --datadir DATASET

where `DATASET` is a dataset listed above. To run the ablation experiments, you
will need to modify the configuration file `AAV` or `GFP` configuration
dictionaries as we have commented in `experiments/config.py` and the run the
`batch_rounds` command explicitly for `--method VSD`.

We have also provided a [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html) run script
for these experiments, see `slurm/run_seq_exp.sh` and `slurm/all_seq_exp.sh`.


### Ehrlich functions

The Ehrlich functions operate slightly differently from the biological
sequences since they are from the
[poli](https://github.com/MachineLearningLifeScience/poli) benchmarks library.

They have their own run script in `experiments/scripts/ehrlich.py` which can be
run from the command line as,

    ehrlich

or run `ehrlich --help` to see a full list of options. For example, to run VSD
with a transformer on the Ehrlich functions with a sequence length of 15 you
could run,

    ehrlich --solver vsd-tfm --sequence-length 15 --max-iter 32 --seed 42

This will log all results to the `ehrlich` directory by default, or you can
specify another `--logdir` location. To plot results, run

    plot_ehrlich --resultsdir ehrlich

Or wherever you decide to save results. We also provide some convenience
scripts for running on a [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html) based
cluster, see `slurm/run_ehlich.sh` and `slurm/all_ehrlich.sh`.


### Handwritten digit generation

The handwritten digit generation experiment (section 4.1 from the paper) is
self-contained in the `experiments/scripts/digits.py` script, to run simply call

    digits

for running the digits experiments with the transformer variational
distribution, or append the `-lstm` flag to use the LSTM variational
distribution. NOTE: this will require a decent GPU with 32GB+ of memory to run
without modification -- we use an NVIDIA H100 GPU. All configuration for this
experiment is contained within the script.

We have also provided a [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html) run script
for these experiments, see `slurm/run_digits.sh`.
